# Cursor AI Rules for Firefly Estimator

## **Overview**

This directory contains comprehensive rules that guide Cursor AI to understand and work effectively with the Firefly Estimator project. These rules ensure that AI assistants follow established patterns, use correct technologies, and maintain code quality standards.

## **How Cursor Rules Work**

Cursor automatically reads `.mdc` files in the `.cursor/rules/` directory and applies them to AI interactions. The rules are weighted by their position and content, with critical information at the beginning and end receiving higher priority.

### **Rule File Format**
- **`.mdc` extension**: Required for Cursor to recognize the rules
- **YAML frontmatter**: Contains metadata like description and globs
- **Markdown content**: Detailed rules and examples
- **Weighted content**: Critical information at start/end for better AI attention
