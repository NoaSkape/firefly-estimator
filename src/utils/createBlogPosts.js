<h2>What is a Park Model Home?</h2>
<p>Park model homes are a unique category of recreational vehicles that offer the perfect blend of mobility and residential comfort. Unlike traditional RVs, park models are designed for extended stays and provide a more home-like experience with residential-grade appliances, full-size furniture, and spacious layouts.</p>

<h2>The Financial Benefits of Going Tiny</h2>
<p>One of the most compelling reasons to choose a park model home is the significant financial savings. Here's what you can expect:</p>

<h3>Lower Initial Investment</h3>
<p>Park model homes typically cost between $50,000 to $150,000, compared to traditional homes that can cost $300,000 or more. This means you can own your home outright much sooner, eliminating decades of mortgage payments.</p>

<h3>Reduced Monthly Expenses</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower utility bills:</strong> Smaller spaces require less energy to heat and cool</li>
