<h2>What is a Park Model Home?</h2>

      title: "Best Skirting Options for Park Model Homes: A Complete Guide",
      excerpt: "Learn about the different skirting options available for park model homes and how to choose the best solution for your needs.",
      content: `
<h2>What is Park Model Skirting?</h2>
<p>Skirting is the material that covers the space between the bottom of your park model home and the ground. It serves multiple important purposes, including insulation, protection from pests, and improved aesthetics. Choosing the right skirting option is crucial for maintaining your home's comfort and value.</p>

<h2>Why Skirting is Essential</h2>
<p>Proper skirting provides several key benefits:</p>

<p>Skirting creates a barrier that helps maintain consistent temperatures under your home, reducing heating and cooling costs. Without proper skirting, cold air can circulate under your home in winter, while hot air can build up in summer.</p>

<h3>Pest Control</h3>
<p>Skirting prevents animals, insects, and rodents from accessing the space under your home, protecting your plumbing, electrical systems, and overall home integrity.</p>

<h3>Moisture Protection</h3>
<p>Proper skirting helps prevent moisture buildup under your home, which can lead to mold, mildew, and structural damage over time.</p>

<h3>Aesthetic Appeal</h3>
<p>Well-chosen skirting enhances your home's appearance and can increase its curb appeal and resale value.</p>
